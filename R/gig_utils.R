    # Implements a recursive algorithm to linearize nested lists upto any
    # arbitrary level of nesting (limited by R's allowance for recursion-depth).
    # By linearization, it is meant to bring all list branches emanating from
    # any nth-nested trunk upto the top-level trunk s.t. the return value is a
    # simple non-nested list having all branches emanating from this top-level
    # branch.
    #
    # Since dataframes are essentially lists a boolean option is provided to
    # switch on/off the linearization of dataframes. This has been found
    # desirable in the author's experience.
    #
    # Also, one'd typically want to preserve names in the lists in a way as to
    # clearly denote the association of any list element to it's nth-level
    # history. As such we provide a clean and simple method of preserving names
    # information of list elements. The names at any level of nesting are
    # appended to the names of all preceding trunks using the `NameSep` option
    # string as the seperator. The default `/` has been chosen to mimic the unix
    # tradition of filesystem hierarchies. The default behavior works with
    # existing names at any n-th level trunk, if found; otherwise, coerces simple
    # numeric names corresponding to the position of a list element on the
    # nth-trunk. Note, however, that this naming pattern does not ensure unique
    # names for all elements in the resulting list. If the nested lists had
    # non-unique names in a trunk the same would be reflected in the final list.
    # Also, note that the function does not at all handle cases where `some`
    # names are missing and some are not.
    #
    # Clearly, preserving the n-level hierarchy of branches in the element names
    # may lead to names that are too long. Often, only the depth of a list
    # element may only be important. To deal with this possibility a boolean
    # option called `ForceNames` has been provided. ForceNames shall drop all
    # original names in the lists and coerce simple numeric names which simply
    # indicate the position of an element at the nth-level trunk as well as all
    # preceding trunk numbers.
    #
    # Returns:
    # LinearList: Named list.
